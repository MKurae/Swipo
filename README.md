#The goal of this game is to move the ball between the walls as many times as possible. You can move the ball by swiping the screen. While the ball moves, the player can hold the screen to move in slow motion. The player is able to take their time to think and aim for their next move. The catch is that it takes energy to be in slow-motion. To regain energy you have to get the ball between the walls, which also gives the player a point.
