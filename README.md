# Swip-O
This is a game that I have made for my final highschool project.

The goal of this game is to move the ball in between the walls as many times as possible. You can move the ball by swiping the screen. While the balls moves, the player can hold the screen to move in 'slow-motion'. The player is able to take their time to think and aim their next move. The catch is that it takes energy to be in slow-motion. To regain energy you have get the ball in between the walls, which also gives the player a point.
